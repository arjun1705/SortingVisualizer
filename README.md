# Sorting Visualizer

A simple sorting visualizer implemented in Java that demonstrates various sorting algorithms with a graphical representation of the sorting process. This project helps in understanding how different sorting algorithms work by visualizing their behavior on randomly generated arrays.

## Features

- Visual representation of sorting algorithms
- Supports multiple sorting algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Heap Sort
- Random array generation for sorting visualization
- Interactive buttons to select sorting algorithms

## Technologies Used

- Java
- Swing for GUI

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- JDK (Java Development Kit) installed on your machine. You can download it from [Oracle's official website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sorting-visualizer.git
   cd sorting-visualizer
